<!--
**mrtaakts/mrtaakts** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
 - ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
-->
 - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as **.Net Core Developer**
 - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Microservices** and **Docker**
 - ðŸ’¬ Ask me **anything** about .Net and .Net Core. Remember, knowledge increases with sharing :) 

 - âš¡ Fun fact: Before being acquired by Google, YouTube was offered to Microsoft for a mere $ 500 million, almost half of what Google ended up paying later.
